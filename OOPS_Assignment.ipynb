    "\n",
    "# 1. Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism)\n",
    "# In Python, you can define methods in a subclass with the same name as a method in the superclass. This is called method overriding. The method that gets called depends on the type of object that is calling it, enabling run-time polymorphism.\n",

    "# Python allows operator overloading, where operators like +, -, *, etc.,\n",

    "# Python follows the concept of duck typing, which is a dynamic form of polymorphism. In \n",
    "# duck typing, the actual class of the object is less important than the methods or attributes \n",
